The latest Platform release, 3.1, is arriving today — August 31 2017. In the previous release, we introduced self-service on-boarding and scaling among other features. In this release we're continuing with the self-service theme. Additionally, we've done a tremendous amount of cleanup work, having fixed several bugs in both the Dashboard and CLI. See the full release notes below.

## New Features
##### Metrics
Platform metrics are now available in the dashboard again. We appreciate your patience while we got this in order.

##### Environment Creation
Customers with self-service contracts have the ability to create and provision new environments completely on their own through the dashboard. To do this, simply navigate to your organization and select the `Plans & Payments` tab. From here you can click the "Create New Environment" button. This will take you to the new Create Environment view. For more details see the gif below:

##### Scaling Volumes
Customers with self-service contracts can increase the scale of volumes associated with their services. These services include Databases and Caches. See the gif below on how to do this:

##### Adding Services
Customers with self-service contracts have the ability to add Code, Database, Queue, and Cache services to their existing environments. To do this, click the edit button next to the environment for which you're looking to add a service. You will then be taken to a list of services. Under the services table you'll see a row of service buttons. Select the service you wish to add. Follow the gif below for more instruction:

##### Sensu Check For SSL Certificates
We've implemented a new Sensu check for SSL certificates. This new check will look for certificates expiring within 14 days. If a certificate _is_ expiring within the next 14 days your monitoring dashboard will show a critical alert. Customers will receive this new update after a service proxy redeploy.

## Bug Fixes
- _Dashboard:_ Improved error handling throughout the dashboard
