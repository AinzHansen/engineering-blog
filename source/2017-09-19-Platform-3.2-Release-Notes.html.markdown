The latest Platform release, 3.2, is arriving Thursday — September 21 2017. In the previous release, we introduced self-service environment creation and service volume scaling among other features. In this release we're continuing with the self-service theme. Read the full release notes below.

## New Features
##### Receipts By Email
New customers and those with amendments to their contracts can now receive payment receipts by email. To enable this feature navigate to your organization. On the "Information" tab you'll see an input for "Billing Email". Enter the email you wish to receive receipts (note: this feature is only available to self-service customers paying by credit card).

##### Self-service Object Storage Creation
New customers and those with amendments to their contracts now have the ability to create and scale object storage buckets directly in the Platform dashboard. This feature is currently only available to the "Admin" group. To utilize this feature navigate to your organization in the left side navigation. Find the "Object Storage" tab. Once inside of the Object Storage tab you'll have the ability to increase your bucket size.

##### Hostnames Correlate to Service Labels
Customers will now see that Service labels are visible in Kibana's 'host' field. (note: customers must redeploy a service before its label will be displayed in Kibana).

##### Organization Audit Logs
The dashboard now includes an organization audit log feature. You can see which organization actions your users are conducting (note: this is currently only available to admins).
