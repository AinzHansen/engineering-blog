I've been working at Catalyze for a little over a month now, and in that time I cannot believe how much I have learned. I must give credit to how we onboard engineers, because it is quite ingenious.

We onboard engineers by having them answer support tickets from our customers. When I first interviewed with Catalyze, and this was explained to me, I didn't have any objections to it, but I was skeptical that it would be better than digging through source code and sitting one-on-one with my fellow engineers to have them explain the architecture to me. I figured it to be some kind of obligatory hazing ritual, and thought nothing of it.

Man, was I wrong! Answering support tickets turns out to be an incredibly effective technique for onboarding an engineer. Not only is it an effective onboarding mechanism, it is also an experience that I am happy to continue (our engineers rotate through support, which is part of what makes our support so exceptional).

Answering support tickets wasn't nearly as coma-inducing as I thought it would be. Catalyze is a cloud provider, so some of the support tickets we receive involve helping people with their deployments. Most of our customers are intelligent and creative individuals and helping them solve their problems actually turns out to be quite interesting. I don't want to paint a false picture, answering support tickets isn't always the most interesting work. The process involves monotonous tasks, problem users, and instances when our own system isn't running as it should be. However, this is where the real beauty of answering support tickets shines. All of these pain-points provide us with invaluable perspectives on what we've built. Monotonous tasks are clear signals as to which tasks should be automated. Problem users help us write better documentation. When our own system isn't running as expected, it is a great way to find bugs; it also helps us to determine if a piece of architecture has too many moving parts and could be simplified.

Answering support tickets helped me to understand our architecture much better than I thought it would. As I answered support tickets, I would have to read our documentation, sift through our source code, and talk to the other engineers to understand how to solve a customer's problem. In the process of answering support tickets I learned the most common code paths of our architecture very well in a very short amount of time.

Too often when an engineer is onboarded at an organization, the engineer gets a brain dump of the architecture, but with very little context. It takes an engineer a long time to figure out what pieces of architecture should be leared first, and which pieces are integral to understanding the overall system. Working with customers made this process much clearer to me, because I gained immediate insight into how exactly our product is being used.

Finally, answering support tickets has made it abundantly clear what we needed to build next. It's incredible how highly aligned the Catalyze engineers are around our core products, and it's not too difficult to figure out why. We all spend time with the customers, so we actually know what their problems are and what they need from us. This makes working support worth its weight in gold. When engineers are aligned organizationally and they actually know what their customers want, it's more likely that they will build what the customer actually needs.
